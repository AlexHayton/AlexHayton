- 👋 Hi, I’m Alex! I live in the UK, but I'm a citizen of Europe. 🇬🇧 💙 🇪🇺
- 👀 I’m interested in anything remotely nerdy and also hugely into sustainability / slow travel.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust, how to raise small humans and how to be a better one myself.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Game Jams, cool startup / open source ideas.
- 📫 It's best to reach me on Twitter or email if you really want to talk. Linkedin is just a mess these days.
